Standardized SEO for some real f*cking SEO

## HEAD

`<meta charset="utf-8">`

UTF-8 declares the character encoding as Unicode.

`<meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="ie=edge">`
Required to support IE 9 or IE 8

`<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1">`
The viewport tag ensures the content on your site scales appropriately to the browser dimensions.

`<title>The Perfect SEO Head Document</title>`
Title tags are used by Google (and all search engines) to display the title of the page. It's recommended to keep all titles between 50-60 characters. If your title is longer than 60 characters (568 pixels) search engines will truncate your title. 

If the title of your page is "This Is A Bad Example Of A Title That Is Way Too Long For Google And Will Get Cut Off", Google will truncate the title and display "This Is A Bad Example Of A Title That Is Way Too Long For Go...".

Your title should be succinct, conversational in tone, and match what the user would expect to see on the page.

`<meta name="description" content="Learn how to create a head section for your website that Google loves.">`
The description tag is a brief summary that you would like Google to display under your title. It's important to know that Google doesn't _always_ display your description.
